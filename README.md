# MRS_analysis

### Description

This repository contains R and Matlab scripts to analyze MRS datasets.

-------------

### Few Important points

 - Please read all the scripts carefully before you run any of them, Please go for the documentation for further information.
 - A bit of programming knowledge is needed, user may need to edit few lines of code in the scripts as per their requirements.
 -

### Repository structure

 - data_generator.R can be used to generate a sample dataset for the purpose of script testing and tutorial. The data file this script generates should be used to see the structure of standard dataset. Please ensure that your dataset follow same structure as generated by data_generator.R script.
 - metabolite_t_test.R script can be used to perform t test between metabolites. It will give information on whether two metabolite's data is significantly different or not.
 - group_t_test.R script can be used to find differences between a pair of group types for each metabolite.
 - group_boxplots.R can be used to generate boxplots for each metabolite with visual comparison between all groups.
 - boxplot-mean-points.R is used to draw individual data point and its mean for each metabolite.
